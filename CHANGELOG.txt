CHANGE LOG

v1.1
- URIs can now refer to files on disk. These images will be cached in the memory cache.
- The SampleSize calculation code has been completely re-written. The image system now loads images significantly faster and uses less memory when large images are being loaded into smaller views.
- A new option called "ScalingPreference" has been added. This option allows developers to choose what logic is used when scaling down images.
- A new option called "preferedConfig" has been added. This option allows developers to change the pixel format of decoded bitmaps.
- An API was added that allows developers to stub their own network libraries into the image system.
- The ImageLoader Javadoc has been updated. The Javadoc comments should now more accurately describe the functionality of API calls.
- Unit test coverage has been expanded.
- Refactored some of the system's internals. Future patches should take less time to develop.

v1.0
- The image library is now stable.
